## Tech Stack
- Angular 20
- PrimeNG 20 + PrimeFlex 4
- RxJS
- TypeScript
- ESLint + Prettier

## Design Choices

- PrimeNG + PrimeFlex for a nice and responsive UI .
- Modular architecture : Each feature (firewall, policies, rules) is isolated under src/app/features/ with its own components, models, and services.
- Shared services : shared-service.ts handles refresh triggers (e.g., reload lists after CRUD actions) to get updated data
- ESLint + Prettier :Used to enforce consistent code style and linting across the project.
- Implemented client-side filtering and pagination using RxJS operators after fetching all required data from the API.
